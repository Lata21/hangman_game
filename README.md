# hangman_game
Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word letter by letter. Here's how to play:

**Setup:**
1. One player thinks of a word.
2. The word should be kept secret from the other player.

**Gameplay:**
1. The guessing player starts by guessing a letter of the alphabet.
2. If the guessed letter is in the word, the player who thought of the word reveals all instances of that letter in the correct positions.
3. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player who thought of the word draws a part of the "hangman" figure. This figure usually has several parts, such as the head, body, arms, and legs.
4. The guessing player continues guessing letters one by one until they either guess the entire word or the "hangman" figure is completed.

**Winning and Losing:**
The guessing player wins if they correctly guess the entire word before the "hangman" figure is completed. They lose if the "hangman" figure is completed before they guess the word.

**Hangman Figure:**
The "hangman" figure is usually drawn in stages as incorrect letters are guessed. There is no single standard for how the figure should look, but it often starts with a gallows and a stick figure and progressively adds body parts with each incorrect guess. The exact appearance can vary.

**Variations:**
- Some versions of the game limit the number of incorrect guesses before the hangman is completed.
- The word being guessed can be based on a specific theme (e.g., animals, countries, movies) to make it more interesting.
- Some versions allow the guessing player to guess the entire word at any point, but an incorrect guess still results in drawing a part of the hangman.
